# ChitChat
An interactive repository for developing User-Friendly UI for chat interfaces


## Pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript
The `html-css-javascript` [folder](./html-css-javascript) contains the code for the chat interface developed using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The interface is responsive and can be used on any device. The interface is also interactive and can be used to send messages to the chatbot. The chatbot is not yet developed and the interface is just a prototype.
